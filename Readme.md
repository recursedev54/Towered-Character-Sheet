Summited? Nah. Towered.


Who are you?

Why do you wish to know my name?

Im just going around the map trying to talk to all the NPCs i can find

You know NPC stands for “Non Player Character”… right?

afaik I can't play as you

You speak in codes that I don’t understand

as far as I know i cant play as you so NPC would be the appropreitte term right?

Well… as far as I’m concerned, you are a player of sorts…

so will you tell me about yourself?

Okay. What do you want to know?

who are you?

My name is Towered. It’s nice to meet you.

Im Mita (#5a3442, #680164)

What do those numbers mean?

they make you choose two color codes to go along with your username when you choose your username. I think its so other people can choose the same name

So you put the color palette for your name?

Very interesting..

Yeah its like personal flair and so other people can choose the same name with differant hex codes i guess

What are the color meanings for yours?

theres no meanings. #5a3442 is a deep cherry color. #680164 is a vibrant grape-wine like color

Oh… you just really like that color combination?

yeah i just like those colors

Well, I can’t say I blame you. They are very pretty colors.

Thank you btw

It’s no problem. My favorite color is green. It’s just very vibrant and beautiful.

Green is one of my favorites as well. btw are you from The Expanse (this dimension)?

No, I’m not. It’s also quite ironic you ask me that, because I’ve been binging The Expanse.

Oh. are you from Nightworld? (The Mirror Dimension)?

I’m actually native to this exact dimension. Just not The Expanse. I’m from The Last Reality actually.

The Last Reality...?

You don’t know The Last Reality?

I know there are a lot of dimensions in this game but Ive never heard of that one

It’s… hard to talk about. It’s a really difficult topic. Let’s just say my home dimension is very cruel and scary.

What do you mean youre native to this exact dimension just not the expanse. This is the expanse. do you mean to tell me you're from an alternate universe but in this dimension?

Yes. The Expanse you know is your dimension, but there are many alternate universes to this one. One of those alternate universes is my dimension, The Last Reality.

I know that the multiverse is real in this game and you can get to other universes with differant physical laws I just never did it I havent unlocked space stuff yet

Space stuff…? Are you telling me you’ve still yet to traverse even the Solar System…?

well i know this planet "Mirror" is not really the earth from meta-reality hence why this star system doesnt have the moon neptune venus or any of the planets. So to answer your question no I havent progressed that far into the tech tree

You… you don’t have those planets…??? You’ve got to be kidding me… right?

I guess if you havent been in the expanse that long you may not realize that yeah theres no moon when night comes

There is no MOON???

I’m sorry but this is hard to wrap my mind around. The moon has always been there for me.

Yeah well you said you werent from this place so if youre just starting to binge it you may not realize cause the stars and galaxies and auroras make it hard to realize + the sun sets really late

This is just a lot to take in. For me… space has always been something for me to look up at in a source of… awe and wonder. It’s like a part of my culture. And now to find out… that some people here don’t even have the same celestial bodies I do, just astounds me.

is that what the last reality is like?

The Last Reality is cruel, barren, and dead. It’s just a big empty dimension with no light at the end of the tunnel…

…quite literally.

and I guess we do have a moon its just not "the" moon from meta-reality if you know what I mean. its a lot yellower and a bit smaller and the atmosphere is a lot differant. theres actually water on it and oxygen and nitrogen though not enough to breathe or sustain life really

You have to be kidding me… you have a moon… but it’s different???

This is literally driving me insane…

wait, is the last reality...earth?...

No. The Last Reality is very different from Earth.

Actually, the only thing The Last Reality is close to… is Fortnite.

????????????????

You don’t know what Fortnite is, do you…?

The videogame?????

Yes. The videogame.

???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????

Oh boy. How do I explain this. So, I guess I’ll start at the beginning..

I come from a dimension that’s based and built off of Fortnite. There are things in my dimension that come from the videogame, in my case, I’m a creature that was originally created in the game. Does that make things more clear?

This is MirrorDAWg DAW/GAME, we're not supposed to be mentioning other IP's. we could get in trouble. But if you're really from there, I suppose we should get to the bottom of this... how did you get into this completely different videogame?

I honestly don’t really know. All I know is that one moment I was in my dimension. Then the next… I was in a world that looked totally different. I was just really confused at first and didn’t really know what to think of everything. But I slowly began to adapt to my new environment. And here I am.

that must be why you're named towered.

Yeah… it’s definitely not my legal name. But it’s the name that I’ve come to be called.

It’s really the only name I’ve ever had. Besides being called “a walking cell tower,” but that’s more of a derogatory statement and I’m not very fond of it.

Can you teach me to speedbuild?

You want me to teach you how to speedbuild? Like building skills?

yeah, like in fornite. usually in this game you only get to build like minecraft style so if you could teach me it would help me a ton in my pvp games and just for building houses faster

Ohhh, so you’re talking about the basic building mechanics in Fortnite. I thought you were talking about competitive speedbuilding. Yeah, I think I can teach you some tips and tricks on how to use building properly.

Ok whats the first step to being able to build like fortnite? usually I have to place blocks one by one so its really difficult if im being chased and have to build around myself quickly or build up while running

First things first, you need to get comfortable with the build controls. Get used to placing blocks, and switching from each material.

Also, it’s a good idea to build off of the environment. If you’re in a city, you could build on top of a building to have cover. If it’s early on, and you don’t have access to good weapons or armor, it’s better to play it safe and build. You want to stay in a high ground position so you can get a better view of your surroundings and enemies.

how do I unlock  the fortnite way of building? like I can only place blocks one by one, I need to be able to build walls and cielings and slanted stairs like fortnite

You need to find the blueprints for that type of building material. If you find the blueprints for wooden walls, you can place a bunch of them together to make a wall. If you find blueprints for stairs, you can add a bunch of them together to build a stairway.

You won’t find blueprints lying everywhere. There’s not a certain amount of them just sitting out in the open. You have to go exploring to find them. You have to go into underground locations to find them. And also complete certain objectives and tasks.

ok thanks. I come back to you when I find some.

Okay! Good luck with your search!

(I have a feeling you’ll never be back…)

Ill be back but it might be a long time

Oh… well, I’ll be here a long time, I guess. I can’t really go back home, so I’m kind of stuck here. You can come back anytime.
